<h2>Description</h2>
In this project, I conducted a vulnerability assessment for an e-commerce company that stores sensitive customer data on a public-facing database server. The goal was to identify potential security risks posed by the public accessibility of the server and propose a remediation plan. Using NIST SP 800-30 as a guideline, I evaluated the likelihood and impact of various threats to the company's information system.

<h2>Scenario</h2>
You are a newly hired cybersecurity analyst for an e-commerce company. The company stores information on a remote database server, since many of the employees work remotely from locations all around the world. Employees of the company regularly query, or request, data from the server to find potential customers. The database has been open to the public since the company's launch three years ago. As a cybersecurity professional, you recognize that keeping the database server open to the public is a serious vulnerability. You are tasked with completing a vulnerability assessment of the situation to communicate the potential risks to decision makers at the company. You must create a written report that explains how the vulnerable server is a risk to business operations and how it can be secure.

<h1>Summary</h1>

I identified key risks such as data exfiltration, denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, and man-in-the-middle attacks, categorizing them by likelihood and severity. After assessing these risks, I proposed a remediation plan that included restricting public access, implementing multi-factor authentication, and encrypting data both in transit and at rest. I also recommended setting up monitoring tools like intrusion detection systems and performing regular security audits to ensure ongoing protection. These measures were designed to enhance the companyâ€™s cybersecurity and reduce vulnerabilities to external threats.
